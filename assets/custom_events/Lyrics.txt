Value1 = Lyrics.
to put a color, you have to write thetext with the final
"--0x" and the color parameter. For example:
Sonic is good--0xFF0000.
Value2 = timer,borders,cinematic,hide hud.
if you want to put just the timer, just put the number,
but if you want to put another action, you have to
put like that:
time:0.5,borders:false,cinematic:false,hidehud:false,refresh:false
